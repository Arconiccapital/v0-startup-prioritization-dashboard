# Vercel Deployment Fix Instructions

## Problem
GitHub pushes are not triggering Vercel deployments. The webhook integration is broken.

## What's Ready
✅ All code is on GitHub (latest commit: ed8c7ae)
✅ Authentication system implemented
✅ CSV upload fixed (sanitizes unknown fields)
✅ Build tested and works perfectly
✅ All environment variables configured (OPENAI_API_KEY, AUTH_SECRET, DATABASE)

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Re-enable GitHub Integration

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/alans-projects-ae605224/v0-startup-prioritization-dashboard/settings/git

2. Click **"Disconnect"** button to disconnect GitHub

3. Click **"Connect Git Repository"**

4. Select your GitHub account

5. Choose repository: **Arconiccapital/v0-startup-prioritization-dashboard**

6. Click **"Connect"**

### Step 2: Configure Production Branch

1. In Git settings, make sure **Production Branch** is set to: **main**

2. Check that **"Deploy Previews"** is enabled

### Step 3: Trigger Fresh Deployment

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/alans-projects-ae605224/v0-startup-prioritization-dashboard

2. Click **"Deployments"** tab

3. Click **"..."** menu on the latest deployment

4. Click **"Redeploy"**

5. **UNCHECK** "Use existing Build Cache"

6. Click **"Redeploy"** button

7. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 4: Verify It Works

1. Visit: https://v0-startup-prioritization-dashboard.vercel.app

2. You should see the **login page** (not the old dashboard)

3. Click **"Sign up"** and create an account

4. Login and test CSV upload

## Alternative: Manual Deploy from Dashboard

If the above doesn't work:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new/clone

2. Import your GitHub repo again as a fresh project

3. Configure these environment variables:
   - OPENAI_API_KEY
   - AUTH_SECRET
   - POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL
   - POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING

4. Deploy

## What Should Work After Deployment

✅ Login/Signup pages with Arconic design
✅ CSV upload saves to Postgres database
✅ Companies appear on dashboard after upload
✅ Investment memo generation with OpenAI
✅ All features from localhost working on production

## Need Help?

If still not working, the issue is with Vercel's GitHub webhook. Contact Vercel support or:
- Check GitHub repo Settings > Webhooks for Vercel webhook
- Make sure webhook is active and has recent deliveries
- Try re-adding the webhook if needed
